                Jeffrey Scott Buckley (November 17, 1966 – May 29, 1997), raised as Scott Moorhead, was an American
                singer, songwriter and guitarist. After a decade as a session guitarist in Los Angeles, Buckley amassed
                a following in the early 1990s by playing cover songs at venues in Manhattan's East Village such as
                Sin-é, gradually focusing more on his own material. After rebuffing much interest from record labels
                and Herb Cohen, the manager of his father, singer Tim Buckley, he signed with Columbia, recruited a
                band, and recorded what would be his only studio album, Grace, in 1994.

                Over the following three years, the band toured extensively to promote the album, including concerts in
                the U.S., Europe, Japan, and Australia. In 1996, they stopped touring and made sporadic attempts to
                record Buckley's second album in New York City with Tom Verlaine as producer. In 1997, Buckley moved to
                Memphis, Tennessee, to resume work on the album, to be titled My Sweetheart the Drunk, recording many
                four-track demos while also playing weekly solo shows at a local venue. On May 29, 1997, while awaiting
                the arrival of his band from New York, he drowned during a spontaneous evening swim, fully clothed, in
                the Mississippi River when he was caught in the wake of a passing boat; his body was found on June 4.

                Since his death, there have been many posthumous releases of his material, including a collection of
                four-track demos and studio recordings for his unfinished second album My Sweetheart the Drunk,
                expansions of Grace, and the Live at Sin-é EP. Chart success also came posthumously: with his cover of
                Leonard Cohen's song "Hallelujah" he attained his first number one on Billboard's Hot Digital Songs in
                March 2008 and reached number two in the UK Singles Chart that December. Rolling Stone included Grace in
                its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time and included Buckley in their list of the greatest
                singers.
